  <br />
  <strong>Scope.</strong> This privacy policy covers all of Simple2Give products, services and offers. It does not, however, apply to other entities that Simple2Give may link to as a result of our offered services, such as partners, affiliates and sponsors of our programs. By using or accessing Simple2Give, you agree to our privacy practices outlined here and on the websites created in support of our offered services with non-profit organizations and associations.
  </p>
<p><strong>Parental participation.</strong> We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before signing up for Simple2Give services or sharing personal information. Although Simple2Give services are designed for social good, we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children about safe internet use can be found on this <a href="http://www.google.com/familysafety/">help page from Google</a>. 
</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy.</strong> When you sign up for Simple2Give you provide us with your name, email, gender, birth date, phone and your zip code and in some special cases you may select to offer more information about your transactions with online retail shopping sites.<br />
Your privacy is important to us. The use of the Simple2Give browser extension will track your visits to any website, but does not store any information about the sites you visit or any of your transactions. Your visit to participating vendor websites is viewed as a Simple2Give visit which in turn notifies our vendor partners to contribute to your cause. No individual user identifying information is obtained or shared during any session. Furthermore, Simple2Give does not use any of your web surfing visits to place ads or share your activity with any third party. Profile information will also never be disclosed to any third party unless required by law.
</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Information.</strong> We use &quot;cookies&quot; (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Simple2Give easier to use, to make our targeted information and your experience better, and to protect both you and Simple2Give.
</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties Partners and Social Networks.</strong> We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use on online retail sites and social networks (such as games and utilities). Whenever you connect with a social network Platform application or website through Simple2Give, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take, like purchasing a book. In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you purchase the book, like the price of the book. Such information may only be used to enhance your experience, such as instant savings offered exclusively for Simple2Give users as part of our partnering agreements with such sites.
</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Information.</strong> We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help too. Please read carefully the following:<br/>
<strong>Steps we take to keep your information secure.</strong> We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Policy.<br/>
<strong>Risks inherent in sharing information.</strong> Although we set privacy options to block access to your information by third parties, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on other sites while using a Simple2Give browser extension will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, changing your password periodically, and using up to date antivirus software.<br/>
<strong>Report Violations.</strong> You should report any security violations to us on our <a href="page_contact.html.php">Contact Us</a> page on our website.
</p>

<p><strong>Other Terms Changes.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy without any notice. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will try our best to notify you. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. You can make sure that you receive notice directly by keeping your information up to date.</p>
